# Knowledge base check

**When:** At the start of a new conversation and at natural break points (e.g. after completing a task, before switching topics).

**Do:** Briefly consider whether anything discussed should be captured or synced to Obsidian, Jira, or Confluence. If yes, offer once: "Should I update your knowledge bases with what we just did?" or "Want me to capture this to Obsidian / Jira / Confluence?"

**How:** If the user says yes, apply the **knowledge-coordinator** skill: triage the information (personal vs public vs both) and invoke **obsidian-knowledge-agent** and/or **public-knowledge-agent** with a clear summary. Do not prompt again in the same conversation unless the user asks.

**Keep it light:** One short offer per break point; do not interrupt mid-task.
